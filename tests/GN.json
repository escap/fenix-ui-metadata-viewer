Implied emission factor for CH4 and activity data are also provided.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This domain contains data on GHG emissions, associated emission factors and underlying activity data. The FAOSTAT Emissions data are estimates by FAO and do not coincide with GHG data reported by member countries to UNFCCC. The database is intended primarily as a service to help member countries assess and report their emissions, as well as a useful international benchmark. The FAOSTAT Emissions data are disseminated publicly to facilitate continuous feedback from member countries.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments:\r\nThe FAOSTAT Emissions database was produced by the FAO Monitoring and Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Mitigation Potential in Agriculture project (MAGHG), with generous funding from the Governments of Norway and Germany, trust funds GCP/GLO/286/GER and GCP/GLO/325/NOR.\"\r\n"

(http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gp/english/).\r\n\r\n\"When no activity (source) data is available, FAOSTAT emissions database results in no data (i.e. no imputations are made) .\r\n\r\nGHG emissions from rice cultivation consist of methane gas (CH4) emitted by anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in paddy fields. The FAOSTAT data are computed at Tier 1 following IPCC, 1997 Vol. 3, Ch. 4 and IPCC, 2000, Ch. 4.\r\nThe emissions are estimated at country level, using the formula:\r\nEmission = A * EF \r\nwhere:\r\nEmission = GHG emissions in g CH4 m-2 yr-1;\r\nA = Activity data, representing rice paddy annual harvested area in m-2  (1);\r\nEF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, in g CH4 m-2 yr-1 (2).\r\n\r\n(1) Activity data are disaggregated into irrigated, rain-fed and upland water regimes, using default IPCC percentages in IPCC, 1997, Vol. 3, Ch. 4, Tab. 4.11. For the period 1961-present, activity data are taken directly from FAOSTAT (domain: Production/Crops) \r\nProjections of activity data for 2030 and 2050 are computed with respect to a baseline, defined as the 2005-2007 average of the corresponding FAOSTAT activity data, and by applying percentage growth rates from FAO perspective studies (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012). The FAO projections used cover some 140 countries. Projections of activity data for countries not included assume the same growth rate of neighboring countries.\r\n\r\n(2) Seasonally integrated EF values are specified for key rice producing countries in the guidelines (IPCC, 1997: Vol. 3, Ch. 4, Tab. 4.13). For countries with no default value for EF, the following strategy is applied: for Asia, countries are assigned an area-weighted average EF (15.7 g CH4 m-2 yr-1); in all other regions, countries are either assigned the IPCC EF value reported for a neighbouring country, where one existed, or they are assigned the IPCC global default EF value (20 g CH4 m-2 yr-1). Furthermore, seasonally integrated EF values are further modified by the application of a dimensionless scaling factor for water regime (i) and a dimensionless correction factor for organic amendments (ii).\r\n\r\n(i) The scaling factors for rice paddy water regime (IPCC, 1997: Vol. 3, Ch. 4, Tab. 4.12) are in the range 0-1. Specifically for all countries a scaling factor of 0.7 is used for rain-fed rice and 0 for upland rice or dry conditions (IPCC, 2000: Tab. 3, page 403).\r\n\r\n(ii) The correction factor for organic amendments is the default value of 2 for all countries, corresponding to the assumption that 40% of farmers use organic amendments (IPCC, 2000: Tab. 3, page 403).\r\n\r\nDimensionless conversion factors used are:\r\n10-4, to convert the activity data from m-2  to ha;\r\n10-9, to convert the emissions from g CH4 to Gg CH4; and\r\nGWP-CH4 = 21 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg CH4 to Gg CO2eq.
